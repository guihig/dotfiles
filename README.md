# dotfiles
My Tiled WM config files

## Xmonad
The original xmonad config was built from this git repository:
* https://github.com/pjones/xmonadrc

I got some additional ideas from:
* https://github.com/altercation/dotfiles-tilingwm

## Neovim
To the neovim i got some ideas from 
* https://github.com/siduck76/neovim-dots -- (The galaxyline theme, so cool c:)
* https://github.com/s1n7ax/dotnvim -- (Mostly the Keybind, Variable, Options and Commands helper funcs)
* https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide -- (A guide to help build neovim config in lua)
